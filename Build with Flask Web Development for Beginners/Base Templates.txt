A base template serves as a foundation for other templates, 
allowing you to define a common structure that can be shared across different pages of your website.

1) Create a base template:
Start by creating a file, typically named "base.html",
which will contain the common elements of your website such as the HTML structure,
head section, navigation bar, and footer.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{% block title %}Default Title{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <nav>
        <!-- Navigation menu items -->
    </nav>
    
    {% block content %}
    <!-- This block will be filled by child templates -->
    {% endblock %}
    
    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

2) Use placeholder blocks:
Within your base template, you'll define placeholder blocks using Jinja2 syntax.
These blocks represent areas that can be customized in child templates.
For example:

3) Extend the base template
In your child templates, you'll extend the base template and override the blocks as needed.
"home.html" template:
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Home Page{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>
<p>This is the home page content.</p>
{% endblock %}

4) Render the template: In your Flask routes, you'll render these child templates as usual.
Flask and Jinja2 will automatically combine the base template with the child template:

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')
