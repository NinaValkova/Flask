Dynamic routing vs GET requests
Dynamic routes are used when part of the URL can change depending on what you want to access.
-The URL path includes a variable (like a user ID, product name, etc.)
-You want to show different data based on the path


A GET request is a type of HTTP request.
It’s the default method used when visiting a page in a browser. It's used to retrieve data.
-You want to get data from query parameters (like search or filters)
-You’re not changing any data on the server
