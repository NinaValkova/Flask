Here are some best practices for organizing your static files in Flask:

1) Use the default 'static' folder: Flask automatically looks for static files in a folder named 'static'
in your project root. Stick to this convention unless you have a specific reason to change it.

2) Create subdirectories: Inside the 'static' folder, create separate subdirectories for
different types of assets:
static/css: For your CSS files
static/js: For your JavaScript files
static/images: For your image files

3) Use meaningful file names: Give your files descriptive names that reflect their purpose, e.g., 'main.css', 'user_profile.js', or 'logo.png'.
